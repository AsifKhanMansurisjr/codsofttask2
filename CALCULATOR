CALCULATOR
TASK 2
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.

a = 'Y'

while a == 'Y' or a == 'y':

    first = float(input("Enter first Number : "))
    second = float(input("Enter second Number : "))

    print("1. Addition")
    print("2. Subtraction")
    print("3. Multiplication")
    print("4. Divide")
    choice = int(input("Choose Operation "))

    if choice == 1 :
        print(f"Addition of {first} and {second} is : {first + second}")
    elif choice == 2 :
        print(f"Subtraction of {first} and {second} is : {first - second}")
    elif choice == 3 :
        print(f"Multiplication of {first} and {second} is : {first * second}")
    elif choice == 4 :
        print(f"Division of {first} and {second} is : {first / second}")
    else :
        print("Invalid Choice !")

    a = input("Want to Continue (Y/N) : ")
